                                Students working on writing assignments can get help with

                                For all other subjects unrelated to writing, students may drop in without an appointment

                                You may e-mail the form to the Health Programs Office. The immunization requirements are
                                as

                                    administered at least 28 days after the first dose. A blood test showing immunity to

                                vaccination within the past five years, you may choose the first option. If you do,
                                you must submit hard copy proof with that date. <i>Hint: You may also choose the third

                                    into your CUNYfirst account and the meningitis hold will be removed immediately.

                                New York State Public Health Law 2167 requires all postsecondary institutions to provide

                                credits or more (or its equivalent) and requires all students (regardless of age) to

                                student’s parent or guardian to the Health Programs / Immunization Requirements Office.
                                The form acknowledges the receipt of mandatory meningococcal disease and vaccination

                            <h2>Women's Center</h2>
                            <p>The <b>Brooklyn College Women’s Center</b> is one of the oldest college women’s centers
                                in the
                                United States. By expanding the conventional direct services approach of traditional
                                women’s centers, which focuses on solving immediate crises through referrals and/or
                                counseling, the Brooklyn College Women’s Center is committed to adopting a wide range of
                                multidimensional needs-driven program activities that address the emotional,
                                intellectual, physical and financial well-being of the whole person. Our challenge is to
                                create, promote and organize programs that raise awareness of women’s issues and in
                                return empower participants to live a life that will reduce victimization, encourage
                                self-sufficiency and independence, and model the skills to help women organize and
                                sustain an environment of self-awareness where they are better able to maintain a
                                healthy life style and make choices that will positively impact their own
                                future.<br><br>
                                <b>Programs and Services</b><br>
                                <b>Daily Drop-In:</b> The center houses the Returning Women’s Café, a multi-function
                                drop-in lounge, the Alice Miller Computer Lounge, and a resource center. Coffee and tea
                                are available during regular office hours.<br>
                                <b>Crisis Intervention:</b> The center provides crisis intervention and advocacy
                                services to Brooklyn College students on academic or nonacademic issues.<br><br>

                                <b>Organizations and Clubs</b><br>
                                <b>The Exchange</b> is a club that is dedicated to on-campus community building and the
                                fostering of open-dialogue and support networks. Brooklyn College hosts a multitude of
                                students from different backgrounds. The Exchange seeks to be a meeting point for our
                                students, providing a safe-space for free conversation, connectivity, and networking,
                                and there’s no better place to do this than over food. Our events consist largely of
                                monthly Friday Potlucks during the semester. Despite COVID restrictions, The Exchange
                                remains dedicated to community through virtual events.
