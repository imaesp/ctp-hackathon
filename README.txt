RESOURCESfirst
Overview
RESOURCESfirst is a web-based platform designed to centralize and streamline access to essential resources for students across all CUNY colleges. Built with the goal of improving resource accessibility and minimizing missed opportunities, RESOURCESfirst serves as a comprehensive hub for departments, offices, organizations, and services available at each CUNY campus. The platform is further enhanced by an AI-powered chatbot, which provides quick answers and directs users to the specific resources they need.

Motivation
As students, we experienced firsthand the difficulty of navigating through scattered resources on CUNYfirst, especially when time-sensitive needs arose. This inspired us to create a platform that addresses these challenges by consolidating all the resources into one location. We believe that by enhancing accessibility, we can significantly impact the student experience and support their academic and personal success.
